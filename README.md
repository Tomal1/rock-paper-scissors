# Rock paper & sicisors

A rebuild of a game which I have made earlier using vanilla JavaScript, this time I have chosen to build the same project using react.
This was a great opportunity to get used to using react after completing the Free Code Camp react tutorial.

## Usage
when the application is run the client will see an Intro screen which also displays a play button.

upon selecting play button the client is taken to another screen displaying three buttons (Rock, Paper and Scissors); If the client selects any one of the three option, the computer will use a Fischer Yates algorithm to choose a selection with an outcome.
